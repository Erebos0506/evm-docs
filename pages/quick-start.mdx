# Quick Start

Depending on your needs and skills, there will be different ways to get started. If you are not a developer and want to mint NFTs, you can use either Singular or Mintaur. If you are a developer and want to deploy contracts on your own, you want to start at the Wizard and then deploy through either Remix or Hardhat, using our EVM template.

## Mintaur

[Mintaur.app](https://mintaur.app) allows anyone to set up a lazy-minting process for a new NFT collection. All created collections use the first 3 modules: MultiAsset, Nestable and Equippable. Multiple configuration options are being added so this can cover most of the artists needs.

The Mintaur app also allows you to follow creators, to be notified when they launch a new collection, and to inspect people's profiles to see what they collected or launched.

Mintaur is currently being heavily expanded, tutorials will be available after a new version is released.

## Singular

[Singular](https://singular.app) is RMRK's flagship product, the multi-chain modular NFT marketplace designed to showcase full modular NFT functionality. Here you can create collections, mint NFTs, add assets to them and list them for sale.

On Singular, anyone can launch a new collection or individual NFT and put it up
for sale. The UI is designed to be intuitive, and the various popover guides
will help clarify whatever might be unclear.

  We have detailed tutorials for every Singular interaction at [Singular Learn](https://learn.singular.app/).

## Wizard

[Wizard.rmrk.dev](https://wizard.rmrk.dev) is a no-code-for-code UI for building custom contracts based on RMRK modular NFT legos. The easiest way to get started building a comprehensive advanced NFT collection without having to write all the code from scratch.

From the Wizard, you launch the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to deploy your contracts. If you need further customization we recommend you download the code for the smart contract and deploy scripts that the wizard produces, and use with our [EVM-Template](https://github.com/rmrk-team/evm-template).
