# Multi-Asset Journey (Part 1, Setup)

#### A contextualized user journey to explore and understand the Multi-Asset NFT features

In this journey we will explore the main features of **Multi-Asset** standard. We will use **Ready to Use** implementation for [Multi-Asset with PreMint](/evm-package/readyToUse/premint/RMRKMultiAssetPreMint.md). For more information on the available implementations see the [implementations section](/implementations). 
We have chosen the **PreMint** implementation because it allows us to mint tokens at no cost. As the contract owners, we can mint these tokens for free.


##### The use cases that will be explored are:

- Creation of an NFT collection that supports asset binding.
- Creation of assets to addition to the NFTs of the collection.
- Asset replacement.
- NFT burning (with relative bound assets).

We will guide you through the process using both Remix and Hardhat, starting from the code [wizard](/quick-start/wizard) in each case.
Interactions will be done from either Remix or hardhat scripts.

#### User journey context

_Expert chefs **Master** and his student **Alice** are traveling the world to develop unique recipes. Their goal is to create a renowned cookbook showcasing their culinary innovations._


{/* Every action will be performed with smart contract functions with the help of some Typescript code. */}


### Creating the Smart Contract.

Let's start by going to the [wizard.rmrk.dev](https://wizard.rmrk.dev/) and configuring our contract. 
1. Set the name to "CookBook"
2. Set the symbol "CB"
3. Select *Module* to be **MultiAsset** 
4. Select *Mint Method* to **Pre-Mint**

![Wizard Configuration](/images/tutorials/multiasset-cookbook/wizard-config.png) 
    
Here you can decide to either use Remix or Hardhat. 
Remix requires no installation, but Hardhat version will take care of verifying the contract and adding it to [Singular](https://singular.app) marketplace, it also allows you to deploy the contracts locally and create unit tests if needed.

<Tabs items={['Remix', 'Hardhat' ]}> 
    <Tabs.Tab>
        <Steps>
        ### Open in Remix
        Click **Open in Remix** and you will be redirected to Remix with the contract already loaded, installing all the packages might take a few minutes. You should then see a screen like this.

        ![Remix](/images/tutorials/multiasset-cookbook/remix-compile.png)

        ### Compile the contract
        Hit **Compile** button and wait for it to process.

        ### Configure the deployment
        * Go to the **Deploy** section on the left. 
        * In the **Environment** dropdown, select **Injected Provider** to use your wallet to deploy the contract.

        ![Remix Deploy](/images/tutorials/multiasset-cookbook/remix-deploy-env.png)

        <Callout>
        Make sure you have the right network selected on your wallet, we recommend to use a test network. 
        In this case we are using [Moonbase Alpha](https://moonbase.moonscan.io/).
        </Callout>


        ### Fill in the deployment data
        Expand the deploy section and fill in all the data.
            - Collection Metadata: `ipfs://QmSU2R1ewXA7vmxD17KQTLRG1nu63KPxDmnb6xdtZ2Hmq5`
            - Max supply: 100
            - Royalty receipient: Your address
            - Royalty percentage: 500 * This is 5% in Base Points.
            Your screen should look like this:
            ![Wizard Configuration](/images/tutorials/multiasset-cookbook/remix-deploy.png)


        ### Deploy the contract    
        * Hit **transact** and confirm the transaction on your wallet.
        * Your deployed contract will show on the **Deployed Contracts** section, where you can interact with it.
        
        ### Congratulations!
        You have deployed your first **Multi-Asset** contract. We will refer to the account used for deployment as "Master". Additionally, a secondary account will be required for certain interactions, which we will name "Alice".

        <Callout type="info">
        Optionally you can add your collection to Singular. See the [Adding Collection to Singular](/tutorials/add-to-singular) tutorial for more information.

            ![Wizard Configuration](/images/tutorials/multiasset-cookbook/hardhat-template.png)
        
        ### Install dependencies
        Go to the project folder and install the dependencies with your favorite package manager: `yarn` | `npm i` | `pnpm i`. This tutorial will use yarn.

        ### Download the contract

        Download the CookBook contract from the wizard and place it in the `contracts` folder.

        <FileTree>
        <FileTree.Folder name="contracts" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="CookBook.sol" />
            <FileTree.File name="MockRMRKRegistry.sol" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.Folder name="scripts">
            <FileTree.File name="deploy.ts" />
            <FileTree.File name="getRegistry.ts" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.File name="hardhat.config.ts" />
        <FileTree.File name="..." />
        </FileTree>

        <Callout type="info">
         You can remove the `SimpleEquippable.sol` file.
         </Callout>


        ### Configure the deployment

        Go the **Deploy script** section of the wizard and fill in the data.
            - Collection Metadata: `ipfs://QmSU2R1ewXA7vmxD17KQTLRG1nu63KPxDmnb6xdtZ2Hmq5`
            - Max supply: 100
            - Royalty receipient: Leave empty to use the same address as the deployer, or set a custom address.
            - Royalty percentage: 5%
            Your screen configuration panel should look like this:
            ![Wizard Configuration](/images/tutorials/multiasset-cookbook/wizard-deploy-script.png)

        ### Download the deployment script   
        Download the script and place it in the `scripts` folder, replacing the existing one.

        <FileTree>
        <FileTree.Folder name="contracts">
            <FileTree.File name="CookBook.sol" />
            <FileTree.File name="MockRMRKRegistry.sol" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.Folder name="scripts" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="deploy.ts" />
            <FileTree.File name="getRegistry.ts" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.File name="hardhat.config.ts" />
        <FileTree.File name="..." />
        </FileTree>

        ### Prepare the environment private keys

        Create a `.env` file by copying and renaming the `.env.example` file. 
        In this file, instead of using a single `PRIVATE_KEY`, set up two separate private keys: one for the Master account (`PRIVATE_KEY_MASTER`) and one for the Alice account (`PRIVATE_KEY_ALICE`), as these are the accounts we'll use in this tutorial.
        
        <FileTree>
        <FileTree.Folder name="contracts">
            <FileTree.File name="CookBook.sol" />
            <FileTree.File name="MockRMRKRegistry.sol" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.Folder name="scripts">
            <FileTree.File name="deploy.ts" />
            <FileTree.File name="getRegistry.ts" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.File name="hardhat.config.ts" />
        <FileTree.File name=".env" />
        <FileTree.File name="..." />
        </FileTree>


        ### Update the hardhat config
        In your `hardhat.config.ts` file, replace the accounts definition with the following:
        ```ts copy
        const accounts = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY_MASTER && process.env.PRIVATE_KEY_ALICE
            ? [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY_MASTER, process.env.PRIVATE_KEY_ALICE]
            : [];
        ```
        
        ### Update block scanner API keys

        In the `.env` file, set the `{BLOCK_SCANNER}_API_KEY` for the network you want to use. You can get keys easily from the block scanner of your network.

        <Callout type="info">
            `API_KEY` from block scanners can be acquired by signing in from the **mainnet** chain explorer, registration is free. The `API_KEY` you get from it works for production and testing networks. Here are the block scanners from the most common networks: [Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/), [Polgyon](https://polygonscan.com/), [Moonbeam](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io/), [Astar](https://blockscout.com/astar/), [Base](https://basescan.org/), [BSC](https://bscscan.com/).
        </Callout>

        ### Compile the contracts:
        ```bash copy
        yarn hardhat compile
        ```
        
        ### Deploy the Cookbook:
        ```bash copy
        yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network {NETWORK}
        ```

        - Available testing networks: `moonbaseAlpha`, `sepolia`, `polygonMumbai`, `baseGoerli`
        - Available production networks: `moonbeam`, `mainnet`, `polygon`, `base`, `astar`, `bsc`
        - After deploy you will see something like this (you may also see a message about the contract having been verified already):
        
        ```bash
        Deploying CookBook to moonbaseAlpha blockchain...
        Deploying contracts with master account: 0xA6cc9397d29b631b69782e5F7fB9801224C8FA90

        Congratulations! You have deployed your first **Multi-Asset** contract. 

        <Callout type="info">
            It is also already verified and registered in [Singular dev](https://dev.singular.app).
        </Callout>

        ### Prepare contract interaction scripts

        To interact with our smart contract we will need to create an instance of the CookBook and attach the deployed address. Since we might need this several times, let's create a script to get the instance. 
        
        * Create a `getCookbook.ts` file under the `scripts` folder and add the following code, replacing the cookbook address for the one you just deployed. When running unit tests in the local hardhat network, it will create deploy a new cookbook, otherwise it will point to the deployed instance. We can use it to interact with the contract.

        ```typescript copy
        import { ethers } from 'hardhat';
        import { CookBook } from '../typechain-types';
        import deployCookbook from './deploy';

        export async function getCookbook(): Promise<CookBook> {
        let cookbook: CookBook;

        if ((await ethers.provider.getNetwork()).name === 'hardhat') {
            cookbook = await deployCookbook();
        } else {
            // REPLACE THE COOKBOOK ADDRESS FOR THE ONE YOU JUST DEPLOYED:
            const cookbookAddress = '0xB4d3b179ACA978A7C0D22dd9E3cA8D6872B204A4';
            const contractFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory('CookBook');
            cookbook = <CookBook>contractFactory.attach(cookbookAddress);
        }
        return cookbook;
        }

        ```

        <Callout type="warning">
        Make sure you replace the cookbook address for the one you just deployed.
        </Callout>
        
        * Create a `journey.ts` file under the `scripts` folder.  We will start by importing some libraries and our method to get the cookbook. All the code will run under the `main` function. We will simply log the two accounts and the address of the cookbook, to make sure they are as expected: Add the following code to the `journey.ts` file:

        ```typescript copy
        import { ethers, network } from 'hardhat';
        import { getCookbook } from './getCookbook';

        async function main(): Promise<void> {
        console.log(`Running cookbook journey on ${network.name} blockchain...`);

        const [master, alice] = await ethers.getSigners();
        console.log(`Deploying contracts with the account: ${master.address}`);
        console.log(`Deploying contracts with the account: ${alice.address}`);

        const cookbook = await getCookbook();
        console.log(`Using Cookbook deployed at ${await cookbook.getAddress()}.`);

        // Journey starts here:
        }

        main().catch((error) => {
            console.error(error);
            process.exitCode = 1;
        });
        ```

        <FileTree>
        <FileTree.Folder name="contracts">
            <FileTree.File name="CookBook.sol" />
            <FileTree.File name="MockRMRKRegistry.sol" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.Folder name="scripts" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="deploy.ts" />
            <FileTree.File name="getRegistry.ts" />
            <FileTree.File name="getCookbook.ts" />
            <FileTree.File name="journey.ts" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.File name="hardhat.config.ts" />
        <FileTree.File name=".env" />
        <FileTree.File name="..." />
        </FileTree>         
       
       ### Run the script
       
       You can safely run it on any network different to hardhat, since there will be no interactions. Running on hardhat will use the default accounts so let's use `moonbaseAlpha`:
        ```bash
        yarn hardhat run scripts/journey.ts --network moonbaseAlpha
        ```
        You should see a similar output:
        ```bash
        Running cookbook journey on moonbaseAlpha blockchain...
        Deploying contracts with the account: 0xA6cc9397d29b631b69782e5F7fB9801224C8FA90
        Deploying contracts with the account: 0x855dF0303Fec3a56c02fE35d8fb4d5e80A8c79A0
