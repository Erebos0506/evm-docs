# ERC-20 Holder Extension (ERC-7590)

This proposal suggests an extension to ERC-721 to enable easy exchange of ERC-20 tokens. By enhancing ERC-721, it allows unique tokens to manage and trade ERC-20 fungible tokens bundled in a single NFT. This is achieved by including methods to pull ERC-20 tokens into the NFT contract to a specific NFT, and transferring them out by the owner of such NFT. A transfer out nonce is included to prevent front-running issues.


In our EVM package, we provide an [abstract implementation](/evm-package/core/modular/tokenAttributes/RMRKTokenAttributesRepository.md) ready to plugin into any  custom implementation from your own, or any of our ready to use implementations. We also provide the [interface](evm-package/core/other/extension/tokenHolder/IERC7590.md) which defines the standard.


## ERC-7590: ERC-20 Holder Extension for NFTs

We published an Ethereum Improvement Proposal detailing the specification of the ERC-20 Holder Extension. If you are interested, you can access it [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7590). It is still on draft so it might suffer. We welcome your feedback on the [magicians forum](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/token-holder-extension-for-nfts/16260).
