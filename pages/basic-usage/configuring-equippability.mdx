# Configuring-equipability

Equippable & Composable is the most advanced module, as it requires both MultiAsset and Nestable ones. After you have deployed your NFT contract, you may add new equipppable and/or composable assets, which can receive children to be equipped or which can be equipped into a parent. 


## Pre-requisites for equipments to be valid

For a token to be equippable there are a series of conditions that need to be met. They are tailored to ensure that only assets from collections meant to be equipped are possible:
1. The slot must be defined in the catalog and it must be configured so that child collection can use it. 
2. The parent token must have an asset with slot parts.
3. The child token must have an asset that is equippable into the parent's slot. This is done through the `equippableGroupId`.

### Equipppable Group Id

To better understand the `equippableGroupId` paramater let's consider the following example. Let's say you have a collection of Soldiers and a collection of Weapons. You want to allow the Soldiers to equip the Weapons in either hand. You would need to:
1. Create a catalog with a slot `WL` for the left hand and a slot `WR` for the right hand. You also configure this slot to be usable by the Weapons collection. This can be achieved by using when creating part with either `addPart` or `addPartList`, or later through `addEquippableAddresses`, `setEquippableAddresses` or `setEquippableToAll`. See the [Catalog section](./catalog) for more details.
2. The parent token must have an asset which includes `WL` and `WR` in its `partIds` array. You do this exclusively with the `addEquippableAssetEntry` function.
3. Each Weapon NFT will have 2 assets, one for the left hand and one for the right hand. All assets meant for the left hand will have the same `equippableGroupId:EGL` and all assets meant for the right hand will have the same `equippableGroupId:EGR`. You need to set the `equippableGroupId` when adding the asset with the `addEquippableAssetEntry` function and you configure each `equippableGroupId` to be equippable into the left and right hand slots of the Soldier collection, respectively. This can be achieved by using the `setValidParentForEquippableGroup` function.

With these conditions met, any NFT from the Weapons collection, nested into any NFT from the Soldiers collection will be equippable into the left or right hand slots.

These are the operations you may need to perform when working with equippable and composable assets:

2. [Equipping a child asset.](#equip-child)
3. [Unequipping a child asset.](#unequip-child)
4. [Set valid parent for equippable group.](#set-valid-parent)

### Adding a new equippable/composable asset  [#add-new-asset]

<Callout type="info">
    In our ready to use implementations, adding a new asset can be performed by the collection owner or a contributor. 
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
    For an asset to be equippable into a parent asset you need to use the `addEquippableAssetEntry` function instead of `addAssetEntry` and assign a non zero `equippableGroupId` to it.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
    For an asset to be composable you need to use the `addEquippableAssetEntry` function instead of `addAssetEntry` and assign a `catalogAddress` and non empty `partIds` array to it.
</Callout>

The asset is added to the collection and can be later added into any token. Our implementations take care of assigning a unique Id, starting by 1. For more details on the contents of the metadata see the [metadata section](/metadata#asset-metadata-uri).
