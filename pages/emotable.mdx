Emotable RMRK extension that allows users to express their impression of the NFT using Unicode emojis.

We designed and deployed a public good emotable repository, that can be accessed and used by anyone. The emote repository is accessible at the same address on all of the networks it is deployed to: [`0x3110735F0b8e71455bAe1356a33e428843bCb9A1`](https://blockscan.com/address/0x3110735F0b8e71455bAe1356a33e428843bCb9A1).

In our EVM package, we provide the [implementation](/evm-package/core/modular/emotable/RMRKEmotesRepository.md) as well as the [interface](/evm-package/core/modular/emotable/IERC7409.md) needed in order to interact with the repository.


## ERC-7409: Public Non-Fungible Tokens Emote Repository

We published an Ethereum Improvement Proposal detailing the specification of the On-Chain Attributes extension. If you are interested, you can access it [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7409).
