# Wizard

RMRK [wizard.rmrk.dev](https://wizard.rmrk.dev) provides a convenient way for anyone to get started building their own Modular NFT solution. It allows the developer to select the preferred RMRK modules, minting method, transferability status, and token URI setting. Depending on the developer’s experience and needs, the Wizard can grant the user a ready-to-use implementation or an implementation that can be further modified to satisfy the project’s needs.

By default, the wizard will start from the most complete building blocks, but you can customize it to your needs and start at any level.

![Building Blocks](/images/General_Overview_Building_Blocks.png)

## Ready-to-use
The ready-to-use setting gives you the ability to decide whether you want the generated smart contract to be fully implemented and ready to deploy and use or whether you want to customize it yourself.

The benefit of using the fully implemented, ready-to-use smart contract is that you can deploy it as is, and you don’t need to spend time implementing your own business logic. This is a great option for artists with some but limited knowledge of coding to showcase and disseminate their art and for projects that don’t need elaborate business logic in their smart contracts.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  By unchecking this option, you can create more tailored solutions, all the while ensuring compatibility with the ERCs that we published.
</Callout>

There are two options that you can select here:
* Continue with the minimal implementation, which allows you to modify the existing functions without the need to override them.
* Remove it and keep only annotations in the form of `TODOs` noting where the business logic should be added with suggestions on what to implement.


## Lego 
The Lego selection allows you to choose the RMRK Lego you wish to utilize. 
* If you are uncertain about the future of your project and cannot decide which Lego to choose, we suggest using the **Equippable** one. 
* If you know that your project only requires multiple assets for tokens but does not need any other Modular NFT primitives, you should select the **MultiAsset** Lego. 
* If you know that you will not need multiple assets for your tokens and only require the ability to nest them, then use the **Nestable** Lego. 
* You also have the option to select **Nestable** and **MultiAsset** Legos together, which allows you to build tokens with the ability to have multiple assets and be nested but not composable through equipping.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  We strongly suggest using the **Equippable RMRK** module to ensure forward compatibility with whatever utility your tokens evolve into.
</Callout>

Using any other module combination should only be done if your business logic causes your smart contracts to become too big to deploy, but even then, you should examine your smart contract architecture to extract some of the business logic to another smart contract.

## Minting Method
We provide support for three different minting methods:
* Pre-Mint
* Native Token Lazy Mint
* ERC-20 Token Lazy Mint

Depending on how you wish your tokens to be minted, you should select the appropriate option.

<Tabs items={['Pre-Mint', 'Native Token Lazy Mint', 'ERC-20 Token Lazy Mint']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>**Pre-Mint** minting method is used when only the issuer of the collection or someone appointed as a collaborator can mint the tokens. These mints are free and can be done to any address they desire. This kind of minting applies to projects that want to mint the tokens and sell them on NFT marketplaces either directly or via auctions.</Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>**Native Token Lazy Mint** allows for the tokens to be minted for a set price in the native currency the token smart contract is deployed to. ERC-20 tokens can’t be used to pay the minting fees in this minting configuration without additional custom business logic. This kind of minting is useful for projects that don’t want to associate their tokens with an ERC-20 token but want to provide a user-driven minting experience.</Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>**The ERC-20** provides the ability to mint tokens using ERC-20 tokens. This implementation doesn’t provide the ability to mint tokens using the native currency of the chain without additional custom implementation, but it can be used to set the minting price in stable coins or another fungible token to add additional utility to it.</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  When using ERC-20 tokens to interact with your smart contract, the approval to interact with the tokens needs to be granted to your smart contract. Without the approval, users won’t be able to mint their NFTs using ERC-20 tokens.
</Callout>



## Soulbound
The transferability of the token can be limited using **ERC-6454**. The Soulbound option adds support for it. Transferability conditions can be further modified by overriding the `isTransferable` method. Using this option, you can disable transfers for the tokens that shouldn’t be transferred or limit the transfers based on the destination or sender.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Using the Soulbound option makes all tokens non-transferable. Without additional custom logic, owners will never be able to transfer them.
</Callout>



## Token URI
The Token URI section defines how a given token’s URI is served. This option is used by wallets and marketplaces to gain access to the token’s metadata. The options we provide are:
* Enumerate
* Per token
* Top Priority

<Tabs items={['Enumerate', 'Per Token', 'Top Priority']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>**Enumerate** The Enumerate way of assigning a token URI is used to automatically assign the token’s URI based on the token ID. It combines the base token URI with the token ID. Such assignment of URIs is useful when the token metadata is pre-generated and uploaded deterministically. This way, all of the token’s metadata can be pre-uploaded with a clear structure and naming convention.</Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>**Per Token** The Per Token way of assigning token URIs requires them to be assigned explicitly for each token. If the Pre-Mint method of minting is used, the token’s URI is assigned upon minting. Otherwise, the token’s URI has to be assigned asynchronously from minting or in some other automated way.</Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>**The ERC-20** The Top Priority token URI assignment is used to serve the URI of the token’s asset with the highest priority as the token’s URI. This is useful when we want to give the users the ability to determine which URI represents their token. They can toggle it by assigning the appropriate priorities to the assets of their token.</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Additional configuration

There are more arcane powers that the [RMRK Wizard](https://wizard.rmrk.dev) has! Let’s check them out.

### Auto-accept child tokens
Nesting a child token into a parent token is a two-step process. It follows a propose-commit pattern where you transfer the child token into the parent token and then accept it as a child token. We provide the ability to circumvent this two-step process in the event that the owner of the child token being transferred is also the owner of the parent token.

### Lock supply
The token supply of the collection is defined upon the deployment. We provide the option to reduce it to the current supply if you decide that no more tokens should be minted, even if the maximum token supply that was defined upon deployment has not been reached yet.

## Deploy script generation
[RMRK Wizard](https://wizard.rmrk.dev) builds the Deploy script for you. If you decide to deploy the smart contracts in one of the development frameworks, like [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org), the wizard auto-generates the deploy script for you. Additionally, you have the ability to open the desired configuration of the smart contract directly in [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

The deploy script generator accepts additional values like collection metadata URI, maximum supply of tokens, price per mint (if applicable), royalties configuration, and more. These values are automatically filled into the deploy script so that the script is ready to be run as soon as you import it into your project.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  All of our legos are compatible with **ERC-2987** royalties, so they need to be configured when the smart contracts are deployed. If you don’t wish to receive royalties, you can always configure the royalty percentage as 0.
</Callout>


## Additional reference
In addition to all of the development help provided by the wizard, it also provides concise instructions on how to set up, build, and deploy your Modular NFT project using the [wizard.rmrk.RMRK Wizardps://wizard.rmrk.dev).

Since you need to have your metadata for the tokens, smart contracts, and assets properly configured in order for them to be compatible with wallets and marketplaces, the [RMRK Wizard](https://wizard.rmrk.dev) contains the section documenting the structure of metadata for each category along with examples of what the actual metadata looks like.

## Remix or Hardhat

From the wizard, you can directly open your smart contract in [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org). Remix will automatically install all the needed packages and will be ready to compile and deploy. We recommend this path if you do not have any further logic you want to add to your smart contract.

If you want to add additional logic to your smart contract, we recommend you clone our EVM-template and download the smart contract and deploy script generated by the wizard. You can then modify the smart contract, add tests, deploy and verify using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org).

<Callout>
  We strongly encourage you to add tests to your smart contracts in this case, and to first deploy to a testing network to make sure everything works as expected.
